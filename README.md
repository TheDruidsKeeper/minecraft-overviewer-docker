> Enhancing the Minecraft Overviewer project

This is to dockerize the [Minecraft Overviewer](https://github.com/TheDruidsKeeper/minecraft-overviewer-enhancements) project. Why isn't this just part of the original project you ask? Because @CounterPillow [rejected it](https://github.com/overviewer/Minecraft-Overviewer/pull/1805) for not wanting to maintain docker builds ¯\\\_(ツ)\_/¯.
